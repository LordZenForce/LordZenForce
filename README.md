- Hi, I’m Jean.
- Right now I’m interested in/learning data journalism and web development(especially back end).
- My favorite hobby is writing and reading fiction.
- I just graduated college (December 2020).
- I want to travel when Covid is over.
- My favorite coding language so far is python (but R is cool too).
