<h1>Hi, I’m Jean👋👩🏻‍💻</h1>
<br>
<p>I am a USA-based local journalist interested in how data can help people make descions and form opinions in everyday life. I am more interested in Python, R and Data Analysis than front end technologies (css especially) although I am working to be more flexible in that area right now.</p>
<p> For work, I am planning on doing a data series. I am also looking into developing my own projects.</p>
